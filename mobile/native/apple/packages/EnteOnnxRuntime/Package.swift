// swift-tools-version: 5.9

// Ente's pinned custom ONNX Runtime static-library XCFramework for iOS
// (CoreML and CPU; device and ARM64 Simulator). SPM downloads the release ZIP, verifies
// its checksum (a plain SHA-256 of the archive, published in the release's
// SHA256SUMS asset), and links the correct slice into the app.
//
// The Rust side (ente-ensu's iOS `ort-sys` dependency) is built with
// "disable-linking" so that it neither downloads nor bundles any other ONNX
// Runtime; the symbols resolve against this static library at app link time.
